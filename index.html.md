<p><strong>Hinkley Point C nuclear power station (HPC)</strong><br>
CAT1 check engineer for calculations on the “special” steel joints for beams N11 and N17. The joints were required to transmit axial forces, shear forces and twisting moment from the beam into the column.</p>
<p><strong>Tilbury footbridge</strong><br>
Design structural engineer for a 13m long existing steel truss footbridge assessment. The bridge had a deformed member, extensive rust and was slightly curved from a boat collision in the past. I have created a detailed FEM model to successfully assess the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>University of Essex, Parkside Phase 2</strong><br>
Lead engineer for the development and progression of the preliminary drawings to a finished construction package. The project consisted o two new-build blocks of two storey steel structures buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Crossrail Anglia, Pudding Mill Lane, GRIP 5 design package</strong><br>

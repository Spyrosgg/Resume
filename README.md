## Experience with Atkins (Jan 2014 - to present)

### Croydon Area Remodelling Scheme (CARS)** 
- **NR GRIP stage 3.** The scheme includes an addition of two main lines, a new high standard station and several OSD high-rise building to achieve a commercially appealing proposal. 
As part of a multi-disciplinary team, my current role is to provide structural input to develop options for addressing constraints and to select the most appropriate option. This includes Participating in station design and constructability meetings with NR, WW+P and Costain, and day-to-day co-ordination with the Architects.
- **Design Elements:**
	-	Design the concourse and podium structures over the platform level that will support the OSD.
	-	High level OSD high-rise building design. 
  

### Crossrail, Farringdon station
- **Designer and technical support.** I was mainly responsible for the low-level design of various steel structures and elements across the entire station (i.e. CAT ladders, Fall-arrest systems, platforms, fixing testing etc.). The design often required non-standard approach and deviation from the Standards which led to frequent site visits, advance FEM modelling and site testing.
I was also participating in Design meetings with the Main Contractor and sub-contractors, which also included joined workshops and site walks. 
- **Farringdon, Steel Fabricators support.** I was responsible to review the detail design and to coordinated between the Principal Designer (Atkins) and the sub-contractors (Steel Fabricators). I was travelling to the sub-contractor’s offices twice a week to provide guidance and preliminary comments that improved the design and accelerated the submission process. 

**UK memorial**

**Hinkley Point C nuclear power station (HPC)**
CAT1 check engineer for calculations on the "special" steel joints for beams N11 and N17. The joints were required to transmit axial forces, shear forces and twisting moment from the beam into the column.

**Tilbury footbridge**
Design structural engineer for a 13m long existing steel truss footbridge assessment. The bridge had a deformed member, extensive rust and was slightly curved from a boat collision in the past. I have created a detailed FEM model to successfully assess the bridge.

**University of Essex, Parkside Phase 2**
Lead engineer for the development and progression of the preliminary drawings to a finished construction package. The project consisted o two new-build blocks of two storey steel structures buildings.

### Crossrail
- **Crossrail Anglia, Pudding Mill Lane, GRIP 5 design package**
Design engineer for several OLE structures and signal gantries which were required to be modified or replaced to allow for the new Crossrail tracks and the re-aligned Down and Up Electric lines to operate. Project main specialisation were steel frame, connection and foundation design

- **Crossrail West Bid**
Member of the bid team for the Crossrail West project which consisted of the re-development of six stations. I was responsible for the assessment of the required enabling works, costs and effective programme development for the tight schedule. Achieving a high level of constructive challenge the team managed to submitted a strong offer to Network Rail.

- **Crossrail Anglia, Platform Extensions**
Lead engineer in ET for the impact assessment of the platform extensions offsets from the rail running, evaluation of the options to achieve requirements, provide recommendations for construction and proposals for related design work.

- **Crossrail Anglia, KO1 Stepping & Gauging**
Leading engineer for Stepping and Gauging automation. Team consisted of 13 civil and 2 software engineers in GDC for the development of new tools for the analysis and presentation of the large data. Several spreadsheets (PROP, POP, SOP & SECplot) were developed which helped the civils team generate the impact assessments and present the findings to RSSB for approval.

- **Crossrail Anglia, DOO**
Driver Only Operation system included the re-design of 9 stations existing stations, form Stratford to Shenfield. I was part of a team which was responsible of the installation of the new cameras and mounting arms, Equipment Cabinet and the Leaky Feeder cable. My responsibilities consisted of assessing the existing canopy infrastructure, propose design for the installation, coordinate between the civils, telecom and MEP disciplines and managed a team of CAD technician for the production of civil drawings.

### Enfield Care Home
- **Three-storey new-build care home centre**

Assisting with the design and producing complete package of structural drawing. Leading engineer for construction technical support as of Feb 2015.

**Duke Street offices, Chelmsford**
Carried out a structural assessment of a 4-storey Victorian building for a change of use from residential to commercial offices.
